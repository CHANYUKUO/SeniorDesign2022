Sicong include a new script called experiment, use it by step and see the logic (detailed comment in each function):

1. Run MasterScript to input the CT images and nii segmented images (CT image contains HU info, nii images are 0s and 1s segmenting out the blood flow region)
2. Use overlapImages function to overlap Hounsfield Unit on the nii graph, the overlapped version is called newnii
3. Use labelImage function to label newnii (calcium lesion is labeled 5), the new output is called labeled
4. Use getCalciumSlices to pseudofind the region of interest, the output is a vector called calciumslices including the slices(z-dim) contains calcium signal.

Next:
If logic correct, add these steps to MasterScript and delete experiment.m and Script experiment explanation.txt
